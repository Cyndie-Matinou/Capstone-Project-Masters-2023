**House Prices Predictions**

**Project Overview**

I choose to work on this project because I have been very much interested in buying a house by the end of the year 2023.
I am that woman who wants to find my dream house/home with a reasonable price tag. I have locations of interest ready, and I want to know if the price of the house matches the value. With this project, I know it will be easier to understand which features influence the price of the house, when they all match, I can be sure am getting a fair price
For data Analysts, the real estate market give an intriguing chance to evaluate and forcast where property prices are headed.
Property or house price prediction is getting more and more crucial and even advantageous. House values are a relatiable predictor of a nation's economic health and general market state.

**Source of the DATA**

So I picked the dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is about organizing a sizable collection of real estate sales records that are kept in unknown format and have unknown data quality issues based on the info supplied.

**Data Overview**
This dataset is made up of 18 columns, with dtypes: float64(4), int64(9), object(5) memory usage: 647.0+ KB.

The columns are price, bedrooms, bathrooms,	sqft_living, sqft_lot,	floors,	waterfront,	view,	condition,	sqft_above,	sqft_basement,	yr_built,	yr_renovated,	street,	city,	statezip, and country. This Data is for America as a whole

**Logical Steps and plans**

For this project my notebook will be solving the problem of predicting house prices.
I plan to use regression model to predict the price of a house based on the other columns from the data

**Some logical steps i will use with ML;**

-loading data and packages

-analysing the test variable which is the sale price

-maybe multivariable analysis

-data cleaning(impute missing data)

-then I will develop a web app to help me predict price of the house then deploy the web app on AWS.After predicting the house prices with machine learning, I will deploy this on AWS

**Deployment**

-I will Create an Infrastructure, using AWS CDK to create an Amazon EC2 instance.

-Automate configuration by using my EC2 user data to install all packages, 

- configure them, and

- deploy the application.
