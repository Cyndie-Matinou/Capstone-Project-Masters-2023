** House Prices Predictions 

I choose to work on this project because I have been very much interested in buying a house by the end of the year 2023.


When My father bought his house here in America I saw him going through so much stress and trying to compare what are the best 

options for him. 

For data Analysts, the real estate market give an intriguing chance to evaluate and forcast where property 

prices are headed. 

Property or house price prediction is getting more and more crucial and even advantageous. House values are a

relatiable predictor of a nation's economic health and general market state.


So I picked the dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is about organizing a sizable collection of real estate sales

records that are kept in unknown format and have unknown data quality issues based on the info supplied.

I am that woman who wants to find my dream house/home with a reasonable price tag. I have locations of interest ready, and I want to know if the price of the house matches the value. With this project, I know it will be easier to understand which features influence the price of the house, when they all match, I can be sure am getting a fair price


For this project my notebook will be solving the problem of predicting house prices. 

** Some logical steps i might use with ML;

-loading data and packages

-analysing the test variable which is the sale price

-maybe multivariable analysis

-data cleaning(impute missing data)

-then I will try a few models the predict
